The immune system keeps the virus at bay, but later in life, usually in an adult, it can be reactivated and cause a different form of the viral infection called shingles (also known as herpes zoster). The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) suggests that every adult over the age of 60 years get the herpes zoster vaccine."

The Iraqi Army 's occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council. US President George H.W. Bush deployed US forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the coalition, the largest military alliance since World War II. The great majority of the coalition 's military forces were from the US, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US $32 billion of the US $60 billion cost."

The scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country. In terms of overall impact, the International Monetary Fund concluded that it was the worst global recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The causes of the recession largely originated in the United States, particularly the real - estate market, though policies of other nations contributed as well. According to the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (the official arbiter of U.S. recessions) the recession, as experienced in that country, began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, thus extending over 19 months. The Great Recession was related to the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 and U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 -- 09. The Great Recession resulted in the scarcity of valuable assets in the market economy and the collapse of the financial sector (banks) in the world economy. The banks were then bailed out by the U.S. government."

This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months (3 in the US and 6 in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. Nowadays, more doctors and neuroscientists prefer to call the state of consciousness an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, primarily because of ethical questions about whether a patient can be called \"vegetative '' or not."

To estimate this enzyme activity, they used that of standardised enzyme acid phosphatase, and found that the activity was only 10 % of the expected value. One day, the enzyme activity of purified cell fractions which had been refrigerated for five days was measured. Surprisingly, the enzyme activity was increased to normal of that of the fresh sample. The result was the same no matter how many times they repeated the estimation, and led to the conclusion that a membrane - like barrier limited the accessibility of the enzyme to its substrate, and that the enzymes were able to diffuse after a few days (and react with their substrate). They described this membrane - like barrier as a \"saclike structure surrounded by a membrane and containing acid phosphatase. ''"

It is derived from the Greek aster, \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (a star) and the Greek eidos, \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (form, likeness, appearance). The class Asteroidea belongs to the phylum Echinodermata. As well as the starfish, the echinoderms include sea urchins, sand dollars, brittle and basket stars, sea cucumbers and crinoids. The larvae of echinoderms have bilateral symmetry, but during metamorphosis this is replaced with radial symmetry, typically pentameric. Adult echinoderms are characterized by having a water vascular system with external tube feet and a calcareous endoskeleton consisting of ossicles connected by a mesh of collagen fibres. Starfish are included in the subphylum Asterozoa, the characteristics of which include a flattened, star - shaped body as adults consisting of a central disc and multiple radiating arms. The subphylum includes the two classes of Asteroidea, the starfish, and Ophiuroidea, the brittle stars and basket stars. Asteroids have broad - based arms with skeletal support provided by calcareous plates in the body wall while ophiuroids have clearly demarcated slender arms strengthened by paired fused ossicles forming jointed \"vertebrae ''."

    "text": "A course entitled \"sociology '' was taught for the first time in the United States in 1875 by William Graham Sumner, drawing upon the thought of Comte and Herbert Spencer rather than the work of Durkheim. In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank Blackmar. The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 and the first full - fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the University of Chicago by Albion W. Small (1854 -- 1926), who in 1895 founded the American Journal of Sociology. American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology. George Herbert Mead and Charles H. Cooley were influential in the development of symbolic interactionism and social psychology at the University of Chicago, while Lester Ward emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883."

For most of the following decade, post-communist Georgia suffered from civil conflicts, secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and economic crisis. Following the bloodless Rose Revolution in 2003, Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy, aiming at NATO and European integration, and introduced a series of democratic and economic reforms, which brought about mixed results, but strengthened state institutions. The country 's Western orientation soon led to the worsening of relations with Russia, culminating in the brief Russo - Georgian War in August 2008 and Georgia 's current territorial dispute with Russia."

    "text": "A player usually carries several clubs during the game (but no more than fourteen, the limit defined by the rules). There are three major types of clubs, known as woods, irons, and putters. Woods are played for long shots from the tee or fairway, and occasionally rough, while irons are for precision shots from fairways as well as from the rough. Wedges are irons used to play shorter shots. A new type of club called a hybrid combines the straight - hitting characteristics of irons with the easy - to - hit characteristics of higher - lofted woods. A hybrid is often used for long shots from difficult rough. Hybrids are also used by players who have a difficult time getting the ball airborne with long irons. Wedges are played from difficult ground such as sand or the rough and for approach shots to the green. Putters are mostly played on the green, but can also be useful when playing from bunkers or for some approach shots. Putters have minimal loft, forcing the ball to stay on the putting surface when struck. The most common clubs to find in a golfer 's bag are the driver, 3 - wood, numbered irons from 3 to 9 (with hybrids commonly replacing the 3 and 4 iron), pitching and sand wedges, and a putter. Players commonly also carry a 5 - wood, and / or additional wedges such as a gap or lob wedge."

    "text": "Erythema chronicum migrans (New Latin, literally, \"chronic migrating redness '') refers to the rash often (though not always) seen in the early stage of Lyme disease. It can appear anywhere from one day to one month after a tick bite. This rash does not represent an allergic reaction to the bite, but rather an actual skin infection of one of the Lyme bacteria species from the genus Borrelia. \"Erythema migrans is the only manifestation of Lyme disease in the United States that is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation. '' It is a pathognomonic sign: a physician - identified rash warrants an instant diagnosis of Lyme disease and immediate treatment without further testing, even by the strict criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such target lesions (bull 's - eye rashes) are characteristic of Borrelia infections, and no other pathogens are known that cause this form of rash. It is also true, though, that the rash in Lyme disease may also be solid rather than bullseye - shaped, so self - diagnosis can not rule out Lyme disease, and a doctor visit is advisable."

In 1908, a Professor Albert Jahnke and the Oakland Transcontinental Aerial Telephone and Power Company claimed to have developed a wireless telephone. They were accused of fraud and the charge was then dropped, but they do not seem to have proceeded with production. Beginning in 1918, the German railroad system tested wireless telephony on military trains between Berlin and Zossen. In 1924, public trials started with telephone connection on trains between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1925, the company Zugtelephonie A.G. was founded to supply train telephony equipment and, in 1926, telephone service in trains of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the German mail service on the route between Hamburg and Berlin was approved and offered to first - class travelers."

A high school court is slightly smaller, at 84 by 50 feet (25.6 by 15.2 m). In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always 10 feet (3.0 m) above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three - point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player 's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free - throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three - point arc at 15 feet from the basket. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points."

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French -- Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft)."

    "text": "In vertebrate anatomy, the pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighing 0.5 grams (0.018 oz) in humans. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. The hypophysis rests upon the hypophysial fossa of the sphenoid bone in the center of the middle cranial fossa and is surrounded by a small bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diaphragma sellae). The anterior pituitary (or adenohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that regulates several physiological processes (including stress, growth, reproduction, and lactation). The intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes melanocyte - stimulating hormone. The posterior pituitary (or neurohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the pituitary stalk (also called the infundibular stalk or the infundibulum)."

This led to trade in gold, ivory, slaves, and other goods with the Portuguese, which gave rise to kingdoms such as the Ashanti. On May 15, 1817 the Englishman Thomas Bowdich entered Kumasi. He remained there for several months, was impressed, and on his return to England wrote a book, Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee. His praise of the kingdom was disbelieved as it contradicted prevailing prejudices. Joseph Dupuis, the first British consul in Kumasi, arrived on March 23, 1820. Both Bowdich and Dupuis secured a treaty with the Asantehene. But, the governor, Hope Smith, did not meet Ashanti expectations."

In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address, or to assign itself an APIPA address, which will not enable it to communicate outside its local subnet."

    "text": "The first modern child tax credit was introduced in the 1909 ' People 's Budget ' of Lloyd - George. This introduced a \u00a3 10 income tax allowance per child, for tax payers earning under \u00a3 500 per annum. Following extensive Parliamentary debate, the Budget became law as the Finance Act (1909 -- 1910) 1910 on 29 April 1910. Since the income tax rate was then 1 shilling, two pence in the pound (5.83 %), the value of the tax credit was therefore 11 shillings and eight pence per child. Since most people did not earn enough to pay tax, this was a subsidy for middle class parents. The nominal value of these tax credits were generally, though not always, increased in line with income tax rates. For instance, by 1916, income tax had increased to five shillings in the pound (25 %), and the tax credit to \u00a3 25, giving a value of the tax credit of \u00a3 6 5 shillings."

The distribution of mass is balanced around the center of mass and the average of the weighted position coordinates of the distributed mass defines its coordinates. Calculations in mechanics are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass. It is a hypothetical point where entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion. In other words, the center of mass is the particle equivalent of a given object for application of Newton 's laws of motion."

Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side, to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone, sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood. Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood. Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington, there are two factors both respectfully agree upon: they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones, the original owner, fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads, and both continue to call \"Animal Farm '' by its original name of \"Manor Farm '', as they believe the name \"Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution. Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber, but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick, which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of \"Death to Pilkington ''. Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber. Through Napoleon 's human aide Mr. Whymper, Napoleon furiously learns that Frederick got the timber for free as he paid in counterfeit money. Napoleon orders the slogan \"Death to Pilkington '' changed to \"Death to Frederick ''. Immediately after the bum deal, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder. Napoleon parlays his new \"Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy, but this proves too little too late as the \"Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory, and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads \"Serves you right ''."

In the late 1980s the licensing laws in England and Wales became less restricted and allowed pubs to allow the consumption of alcohol on the premises from 11: 00 until 23: 00, although nightclubs were allowed to stay open much later. Significantly revised rules were introduced in November 2005, when hour limits were scrapped, and pubs were allowed to apply for licences as permissive as \"24 hours a day ''.

    "text": "A pinhole occluder is an opaque disk with one or more small holes through it, used by ophthalmologists, orthoptists and optometrists to test visual acuity. The occluder is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, temporarily removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only through the center of the eye 's lens, defects in the shape of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the occluder is used. In this way the ophthalmologist, orthoptist or optometrist can estimate the maximum improvement in a patient 's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. This can be used to distinguish visual defects caused by refractive error, which improve when the occluder is used, from other problems, which do not. The pinhole occluder can also be used in testing visual acuity in mydriatic patients. In this case the pinhole occluder compensates for the inability to contract the iris assisting the eye in obtaining a retinal projection similar to that of a non-cycloplegic eye."

    "text": "While Greek sculptors traditionally illustrated military exploits through the use of mythological allegory, the Romans used a more documentary style. Roman reliefs of battle scenes, like those on the Column of Trajan, were created for the glorification of Roman might, but also provide first - hand representation of military costumes and military equipment. Trajan 's column records the various Dacian wars conducted by Trajan in what is modern day Romania. It is the foremost example of Roman historical relief and one of the great artistic treasures of the ancient world. This unprecedented achievement, over 650 foot of spiraling length, presents not just realistically rendered individuals (over 2,500 of them), but landscapes, animals, ships, and other elements in a continuous visual history -- in effect an ancient precursor of a documentary movie. It survived destruction when it was adapted as a base for Christian sculpture. During the Christian era after 300 AD, the decoration of door panels and sarcophagi continued but full - sized sculpture died out and did not appear to be an important element in early churches."

In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in Gasp\u00e9 bearing the French royal coat of arms with the fleurs - de-lis. His ship flew a red flag with a white cross, the French naval flag at the time. New France continued to fly the evolving French military flags of that period. As the de jure national flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Flag (commonly known as the Union Jack and, by law, called the Royal Union Flag in Canada since 1964) was used similarly in Canada since the 1621 British settlement in Nova Scotia. Its use continued after Canada 's independence from the United Kingdom in 1931 until the adoption of the current flag in 1965."

Japanese rule over Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan. A major stepping - stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then - Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan. The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong."

In earlier Greek, such as Homeric Greek, the name had been current in the singular form though, as \u1f08\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 (Ath\u0113n\u0113). It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of \u0398\u1fc6\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9 (Th\u00eabai) and \u039c\u03c5\u03ba\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 (\u039cuk\u00eanai). The root of the word is perhaps not of Greek or Indo - European origin, and is a possible remnant of the Pre-Greek substrate of Attica, as could be the name of the goddess Athena (Attic \u1f08\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u1fb6, Ath\u0113n\u0101, Ionic \u1f08\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7, Ath\u0113n\u0113, and Doric \u1f08\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1, Ath\u0101n\u0101), that was always related to the city of Athens. During the medieval period the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as \u1f08\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1. However, after the establishment of the modern Greek state, and partly due to the conservatism of the written language, \u1f08\u03b8\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 (a\u02c8\u03b8ine) became again the official name of the city and remained so until the abandonment of Katharevousa in the 1970s, when \u1f08\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, Ath\u00edna, became the official name."

He originally sold two handmade bobby pins for 35 cents. Although Marcus thought about naming the pin after himself, he named them bobby after the bobbed hairstyle. A trademark on the term \"bobbie pin '' was held for some decades by Smith Victory Corporation of Buffalo, New York. A trademark infringement claim made by Smith Victory Corporation against Procter & Gamble regarding their naming their home permanent product Bobbi was settled in the 1950s by a payment to Smith Victory Corporation by P&G. The term is now in common usage and therefore is no longer a valid trademark. Similarly, the British \"kirby grip '' is derived from the trademark Kirbigrip, used by a Birmingham manufacturer of such pins, Kirby, Beard & Co. Ltd."

Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. The cladistic term for the same phenomenon is homoplasy. The recurrent evolution of flight is a classic example, as flying insects, birds, pterosaurs, and bats have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are analogous, whereas homologous structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions. Bird, bat, and pterosaur wings are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions."

The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The smallest of the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico was a stepping - stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish -- American War, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain 's final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church."

Parker 's philosophy deviated from the prevalent theme of board game design; he believed that games should be played for enjoyment and did not need to emphasize morals and values. He created his first game, called Banking, in 1883 when he was 16. Banking is a game in which players borrowed money from the bank and tried to generate wealth by guessing how well they could do. The game included 160 cards which foretold their failures or successes. The game was so popular among family and friends that his brother, Charles Parker, urged him to publish it. George approached two Boston publishers with the idea, but was unsuccessful. Not discouraged, he spent $40 to publish 500 sets of Banking. He eventually sold all but twelve copies, making a profit of $100."

ACDs often use a voice menu to direct callers based on the customer 's selection, telephone number, selected incoming line to the system or time of day the call was processed. Computer telephony integration (CTI) and computer - supported telecommunications applications (CSTA) are intermediate software that can produce advanced ACD systems.

(James had offered the first shot to Roger Pryor, a noted Virginia secessionist, who declined, saying, \"I could not fire the first gun of the war. '') The shell exploded over Fort Sumter as a signal to open the general bombardment from 43 guns and mortars at Fort Moultrie, Fort Johnson, the floating battery, and Cummings Point. Under orders from Beauregard, the guns fired in a counterclockwise sequence around the harbor, with 2 minutes between each shot; Beauregard wanted to conserve ammunition, which he calculated would last for only 48 hours. Edmund Ruffin, another noted Virginia secessionist, had traveled to Charleston to be present for the beginning of the war, and fired one of the first shots at Sumter after the signal round, a 64 - pound shell from the Iron Battery at Cummings Point. The shelling of Fort Sumter from the batteries ringing the harbor awakened Charleston 's residents (including diarist Mary Chesnut), who rushed out into the predawn darkness to watch the shells arc over the water and burst inside the fort."

L. 93 -- 618, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411) authorizes the President to take all appropriate action, including retaliation, to obtain the removal of any act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that violates an international trade agreement or is unjustified, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and that burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. Section 301 cases can be self - initiated by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) or as the result of a petition filed by a firm or industry group. If USTR initiates a Section 301 investigation, it must seek to negotiate a settlement with the foreign country in the form of compensation or elimination of the trade barrier. For cases involving trade agreements, the USTR is required to request formal dispute proceedings as provided by the trade agreements. The law does not require that the U.S. government wait until it receives authorization from the World Trade Organization (WTO) to take enforcement actions, and the President is increasingly focused on enforcing intellectual property (IP) rights (under Agreements that may be outside of the WTO) under the \"Special '' 301 amendments but the U.S. has committed itself to pursuing the resolution of disputes under WTO agreements through the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, which has its own timetable."

She was originally to record Jimmy Ruffin 's \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted '' as the lead single from The Bodyguard. However, when it was discovered the song was to be used for Fried Green Tomatoes, Houston requested a different song. It was her co-star Kevin Costner who suggested \"I Will Always Love You '', playing her Linda Ronstadt 's 1975 version from her album Prisoner in Disguise. Producer David Foster re-arranged the song as an R&B ballad. Her record company did not feel a song with an a cappella introduction would be as successful; however, Houston and Costner insisted on retaining it. When Parton heard that Houston was using Ronstadt 's recording as a template, she called Foster to give him the final verse, which was missing from the Ronstadt recording, as she felt it was important to the song. The tenor saxophone solo was played by Kirk Whalum. Whitney Houston 's recording is not the only version of the song featured in the movie. In a scene where she dances with Kevin Costner, a version by John Doe can be heard playing on a jukebox."

His first notable recordings for Contemporary Records included Tomorrow Is the Question! and Something Else in 1958, garnering Coleman national recognition.

    "text": "No. overall No. in season Title Directed by Written by UK air date UK viewers (millions) 7 \"China Girl '' Jane Campion Jane Campion & Gerard Lee 27 July 2017 (2017 - 07 - 27) 3.39 In Sydney, brothel owners Bootie and Dang throw a heavy suitcase off a cliff into the ocean. Four years after the events with Tui, Robin tries to adjust back to life in Sydney while dealing with residual PTSD from shooting Al Parker. Parker turned witness in the case of the paedophile ring in exchange for immunity, but has now filed a civil suit against Robin, claiming the shooting was personally motivated. Robin 's daughter, Mary, is now nearly 18 and exhibiting signs of mental instability that her adoptive parents worry is more than teen angst. Unbeknownst to her parents, Mary is dating a 42 - year - old German, Alexander, nicknamed \"Puss '', who lives above a brothel, Silk 41. Mary is enamoured with Puss, who claims to be \"empowering '' the young Asian prostitutes by teaching them English and other life lessons. Mary is aggressively rebelling and openly hostile against her adoptive parents, Pyke and Julia, who are getting a divorce after Julia came out as a lesbian. Pyke and Julia are appalled after meeting Puss, who informs them he plans to marry Mary. Robin 's new boss, Detective Sergeant Adrian Butler, brings a large stuffed panda to a young Asian woman. Brett, a socially awkward university student who frequents brothels, worries because he ca n't find a prostitute named Cinnamon, whom he believes is his girlfriend. Meanwhile, the suitcase washes up on Bondi Beach and it contains the decomposing body of a woman. Robin and a rookie constable, the awkward Miranda, are assigned to the case. 8 \"The Loved One '' Ariel Kleiman Jane Campion & Gerard Lee 3 August 2017 (2017 - 08 - 03) 2.38 A flashback reveals that four weeks earlier, Johnno was arrested on their wedding day after his pot farm was raided, and Robin left him after discovering he had cheated on her as well. Meanwhile, Tui is now raising her son at the women 's commune. In the present, Robin, who had three miscarriages while with Johnno, has nightmares about babies. Robin is obsessed with the case of the Asian Jane Doe found in the suitcase, dubbed \"China Girl, '' whose cause of death was possibly strangulation. With no matching reports from missing persons, they suspect she was working as a prostitute, possibly entering the country with a false passport. Robin and Miranda observe the autopsy, where the coroner learns that China Girl was about 17 weeks pregnant. An emotional Miranda leaves the autopsy when she sees the tiny foetus, and she later reveals she is 18 weeks pregnant. Robin is irritated by Miranda, but Adrian insists they work together, because nobody else will work with either of them. They visit brothels, which are legal in Sydney. Robin notices a large stuffed panda at one, Silk 41, and asks Adrian what happened to the one he had in his office. He claims he gave it to his son. Brett goes to Silk 41 to find Cinnamon, and is eventually told she went to Canberra. He refuses to believe she would without telling him. Robin finally works up the courage to contact Mary, leaving a letter at the Edwards ' home. She first meets with Pyke and Julia at his office, and Julia angrily informs her that Mary 's behavioural problems began four years earlier, after she never received a reply to the letter she sent Robin. She chastises her for not having the decency to respond, and that Mary agonised over whether she had said something wrong in the letter. Julia storms off, but Pyke is more patient and listen as Robin explains she was just 16 years old when Mary was born. Robin is able to meet Mary, who behaves oddly and exhibits very low self - esteem. Mary reveals she assumed that she was the product of rape, which Robin confirms. Mary volunteers to murder her mother 's rapist, and Robin confesses that she never knew who the father was, being a victim of a gang rape. A DNA test on the male foetus reveals China Girl was not his biological mother, mystifying the pathologist. Robin, though, realises the dead girl was acting as a surrogate mother, changing the course of the investigation. 9 \"Surrogate '' Ariel Kleiman Jane Campion & Gerard Lee 10 August 2017 (2017 - 08 - 10) 1.97 Robin believes that China Girl was acting as an illegal surrogate, as the law states surrogates must be over 25 and have already had a child of their own, and thus the biological parents were working outside the normal system. She and Miranda visit a fertility clinic, where a doctor tells Robin that although many parents may be desperate enough to try illegal surrogacy, that would bring great risk as the law would side with the surrogate mother, who could decide to keep the child. Robin comes out to see Miranda arguing with the receptionist. Robin gets a lead after potentially finding the biological parents for whom China Girl was a surrogate, after a mentally unstable woman is wandering in traffic, crying about her missing baby. Robin visits the woman, Felicity, and her husband, Mike, in the psychiatric ward. Mike, who has a criminal record for cocaine possession, eventually agrees to take a DNA test. Robin is irritated by Miranda, who smokes and drinks despite her pregnancy, and who is now sleeping with Robin 's brother on top of having an affair with the married Adrian. Another detective, Stally, continues to make unwanted advances on Robin. After some investigating, Pyke and Julia confront Puss with the fact that he is already married, causing him to have a bizarre outburst in a restaurant and a further rift between them and Mary. Puss locks himself in his apartment and refuses to see Mary or any of the prostitutes in to see him. After being called by Pyke, Robin takes Mary to her apartment, where Mary breaks down because of Puss refusing to see her. Robin 's mediation with Al, now confined to a wheelchair, does not go as planned when he tries to kill her before it begins. 10 \"Birthday '' Ariel Kleiman Jane Campion & Gerard Lee 17 August 2017 (2017 - 08 - 17) 1.92 Puss manipulates Mary to start working as a prostitute when she turns 18, mocking her for her privileged upbringing and implying she thinks she is better than her friends at the brothel. Pyke and Mary attend her school 's Daddy / Daughter dance, which he has been looking forward to. Mary at first stops to check on Puss, who talks his way into attending, claiming he is her \"Daddy. '' At the dance, he interrupts Pyke and Mary 's waltz and causes outrage when he begins dancing sexually with Mary, and is thrown out. Brett, who has seen the news about the Asian Jane Doe, contacts the police and gives them a photo of Cinnamon. Upset that the police consider him a suspect, Brett tells them about the creepy guy at the brothel. As he describes him, Robin fears he is talking about Mary 's boyfriend. Mary takes some of the prostitutes (whom she claims are students) to the beach with her, Pyke and Robin, to teach them how to swim. Puss comes along and, after noticing Robin 's air of hostility towards him, he brings up her rape, makes sexually suggestive remarks and then violently attacks her, biting her on the nose. Mary, screaming and hitting herself in the head, convinces Robin not to press charges. The DNA test reveals that Felicity and Mike are not the biological parents, but Robin is shocked to find out they have three young Asian women as surrogate mothers. Mary asks Dang to start working there, and Dang refuses. On Mary 's 18th birthday, Puss takes Mary to a hookers ' strip. She says she is afraid and he hits her in the face. He tells her that is worse than what any John will do to her, and now she does n't have to be afraid, and then leaves her there. Unable to complete the act, she is thrown out of a car by a John, and phones Robin for help. In Robin 's car, Mary sees the photo of Cinnamon, whom she recognises. Robin hints that Mary is in great danger. At Robin 's apartment, Mary breaks down crying, saying she does n't know how to leave him. 11 5 \"Who 's Your Daddy '' Jane Campion Jane Campion & Gerard Lee 24 August 2017 (2017 - 08 - 24) 1.69 Mary leaves the safety of Robin 's home to reconnect with Puss, who learns from her that Robin is looking into the murder of Cinnamon. Robin tells Pyke about picking Mary up from under the overpass. Pyke wants to kill Puss, and Robin says even she arrests him, she knows he wo n't be held long. Brett becomes further unhinged after identifying her Cinnamon 's body and begins suffering from hallucinations. Miranda has another crying spell at work and admits she fears her baby has died. They return to the same fertility clinic where Miranda shows the receptionist the photo of Cinnamon, and demands to know if she recognises her. Miranda informs her that the girl in the photo was not a student, but a sex worker, and then starts screaming that she wants an ultrasound. Robin takes her out to the beach to calm down, where Miranda reveals she is not actually pregnant and that her pregnancy is being done via surrogacy because of her own fertility issues. Miranda says their surrogate is pregnant with a daughter but has gone missing, and she fears it is because of a miscarriage. Miranda still insists that their surrogate was a student, but Robin asks if Adrian gave her a stuffed panda, because she saw one at Silk 41. A doctor at the fertility clinic, unaware that the girls were sex workers, connects Robin with a couple who identify Cinnamon as their surrogate mother, whose real name was Pathma. With the assistance of Mary 's schoolfriend Michaela, Puss directs make some sort of \"art film '' with the prostitutes and Caucasian babies, set in a Thai village. Mary becomes worried when Caramel, another pregnant girl from Silk 41, is taken away by Puss and Dang. Connected by concern over Mary and Puss, Robin and Pyke grow closer, much to Julia 's annoyance and jealousy. Brett, armed with a rifle, shows up at the brothel and demands to see Puss. Puss pushes Mary in front of him and escapes in the elevator as Brett fires the gun. 12 6 \"The Battle of the Mothers '' Ariel Kleiman Jane Campion & Gerard Lee 31 August 2017 (2017 - 08 - 31) 1.84 Robin and Pyke make love when she receives a late - night call from Mary. Nobody speaks, but Robin hears people arguing about a taxi fare and Mary screams before the phone is disconnected. Miranda calls and tells her there was a shooting at Silk 41, and that the suspect is Brett Iles, who took Mary hostage. The taxi is found at Bondi Beach, with the taxi driver shot dead. Security footage from the brothel shows Puss escaping as Brett shot Bootie, before leaving with Mary. The security footage also shows another room, in which Miranda spots her surrogate. That room is not at the brothel, and none of the sex workers know its location. The next day, Pyke and Julia go to Mary 's school to appeal to her classmates for any information. Michaela tells them about a place on Liverpool Street called Stasi Cafe, where Mary first met Puss. The manhunt for Brett intensifies, but Robin is convinced he 's still on Bondi Beach, now packed with people. She notices an empty case of beer that was there the previous night. She and Miranda move in and try to quietly move beachgoers away from the box. One group refuses to move and distracts Robin while Miranda discovers a shoe sticking out from the sand. She kicks the box away to find Brett 's face peeking out, his eyes closed. Miranda moves in to check his pulse. Robin yells at Miranda to draw her weapon but she freezes. Brett suddenly pulls the rifle out of the sand and shoots Miranda in the abdomen. Robin jumps on him, her gun to his head, demanding to know where Mary is. Meanwhile, Mary shows up at home, unharmed. Crying, Julia begs her to stay, promising that she will change and try to understand her, but Mary leaves. Robin visits the hospital, where Miranda is in a coma, her outlook grim. Adrian vows to tell everyone he loves her, and begs Robin to find their surrogate. Robin finds Pyke at Stasi Cafe, where they kiss and embrace. He leaves after getting a text from Julia informing him that Mary 's passport is missing. Robin then finds Puss in the kitchen, where she cuts him with a kitchen knife. He claims that Cinnamon hanged herself. Robin puts her gun to his head and he discloses the address of the missing surrogates, giving her the key. She shows up to find not only Adrian but the other expectant couples, including Felicia and Mike, all of whom received calls from their surrogates. They find the apartment empty, with a DVD left behind. Meanwhile, Mary escorts the dozen or so surrogates through the airport. Puss shows up as they board the plane, and Mary, upset, tells him that she could have been shot while he fled. He lies and tells her the elevator doors closed and he could n't do anything. She asks what will happen to the babies and who will love them, and he tells them the \"people who made them '' will buy them back. She pulls away and he slaps her. She hits him back, over and over. Caramel calls for Mary, but she refuses to board and watches him leave. At the apartment, Adrian plays the DVD, which shows the video shot at the brothel of the Thai women with the babies. Puss narrates, mocking the parents, and accusing the West of exploiting the bodies of oppressed Asian women through prostitution and now surrogacy. He declares that their babies have flown away but each one will bring enough money to feed an entire poor village, as the video shows Bootie handing a bundle of cash in exchange for a white baby. Robin rushes to the airport, while the couples become hysterical, begging Adrian to call the airport and detain the women who are kidnapping their children. Adrian, stunned, tells them there is nothing that can be done legally, as the women can do whatever they want, even while pregnant with another mother 's child. Robin arrives at the airport and finds an empty gate, with just the stuffed panda. Mary, however, is safe with her parents. Robin arrives at the Edwards ' home, where Julia says she and Pyke are going to give it another try as a couple. Before she leaves, Robin asks if she can borrow the DVD Pyke told her about, showing Mary growing up. Julia protests and says it is their only copy, so Pyke says he will come pick it up as soon as Robin has finished watching it, which Robin says she will do that evening. Julia looks concerned, but says nothing. Later that night, Robin watches the video, crying happy tears, then looks up as she hears a knock on her door -- presumably from Pyke."

Despite the Qin 's state ideology and Mohism being similar in certain regards, it is possible that Mohists were sought and killed by the state 's armies due to paramilitary activities."

They contracted Saban Entertainment to help distribute the series to television, and Pioneer Entertainment to handle home video distribution. The Vancouver - based Ocean Studios were hired by Funimation to dub the anime (Funimation had previously used the Ocean voice cast in their short - lived 1995 dub of Dragon Ball). Saban musicians Ron Wasserman and Jeremy Sweet, known for their work on the Power Rangers franchise, composed a new background score and theme song (nicknamed \"Rock the Dragon ''). Funimation 's initial English dub of Dragon Ball Z had mandated cuts to content and length, which reduced the first 67 episodes into 53. It premiered in the United States on September 13, 1996 in first - run syndication, but halted production in 1998 after two seasons. This was due to Saban scaling down its syndication operations, in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids block. Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 (the end of the dub) and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version, but did not do so."

Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769 the Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from Natchez to resettle on the Iberville or Amite river closer to New Orleans."

Originally a part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, India broke away from the other fragments of Gondwana 100 million years ago and began moving north. Once fused with the adjacent Australia to form a single Indo - Australian Plate, recent studies suggest that India and Australia have been separate plates for at least 3 million years and likely longer. The Indian plate includes most of South Asia -- i.e. the Indian subcontinent -- and a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean, including parts of South China and western Indonesia, and extending up to but not including Ladakh, Kohistan and Balochistan."

    "text": "The Detroit River flows for 24 nautical miles (44 km; 28 mi) from Lake St. Clair to Lake Erie. By definition, this classifies it as both a river and a strait -- a strait being a narrow passageway connecting two large bodies of water, which is how the river earned its name from early French settlers. However, today, the Detroit River is rarely referred to as a strait, because bodies of water referred to as straits are typically much wider. The Detroit River is only 0.5 to 2.5 miles (0.80 to 4.02 km) wide. The Detroit River starts on an east to west flow but then bends and runs north to south. The deepest portion of the Detroit River is 53 feet (16 m) deep in the northern portion of the river. At its source, the river is at an elevation of 574 feet (175 m) above sea level. The river drops only three feet before entering into Lake Erie at 571 feet (174 m). As the river contains no dams and no locks, it is easily navigable by even the smallest of vessels. The watershed basin for the Detroit River is approximately 700 square miles (1,800 km). Since the river is fairly short, it has few tributaries. Its largest tributary is the River Rouge in Michigan, which is actually four times longer than the Detroit River and contains most of the basin. The only other major American tributary to the Detroit River is the much smaller Ecorse River. Tributaries on the Canadian side include Little River, Turkey Creek and the River Canard. The discharge for the Detroit River is relatively high for a river of its size. The river 's average discharge is approximately 188,000 cubic feet per second (5,324 m3 / s), and the river 's flow is constant."

    "text": "Contraception was legal in the United States throughout most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a social purity movement grew in strength, aimed at outlawing vice in general, and prostitution and obscenity in particular. Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle - class women, the Victorian - era campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an immoral practice that promoted prostitution and venereal disease. Anthony Comstock, a postal inspector and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law prohibiting mailing of \"any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion '' as well as any form of contraceptive information. Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the Comstock laws), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the use of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was proud of the fact that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets."

    "text": "Character Actor Info Lulu Coltrane Hogg Peggy Rea Boss Hogg 's wife, Hughie Hogg 's aunt, and Rosco 's sister. Lulu constantly challenged her husband for authority and rallied for the equality of women in Hazzard, and was one of the few people in Hazzard whom Boss was actually intimidated by, though he genuinely loved and cared for her. Although much mentioned, Lulu only appeared once during the first season (in the episode \"Repo Men '') and once during the second season (\"The Rustlers ''), before her appearances gradually increased over the third season. By the fourth season, she was a frequently - seen recurring character. Initially in her single first and second season appearances, she was portrayed to be rather spoiled and selfish; as her appearances increased, the character evolved into being more caring and kind -- often to the contrast of Boss, and which on occasion proved to be his downfall or Achilles ' heel. Although Boss is a nemesis to the Dukes, Lulu is best friends with Daisy. Myrtle / Mabel Tillingham Lindsay Bloom Mabel is Hogg 's cousin who runs the Hazzard Phone Company, who often sneak listens to calls and lets Hogg know what 's going on. Her name mysteriously changed from Myrtle to Mabel midway through the second season. Longstreet B. Davenport Ernie Lively (credited as Ernie W. Brown) L.B. was Cooter 's cousin who filled for Cooter when he was away from the garage in several second - season episodes (in reality, this was to cover for Ben Jones ' absence, after a disagreement with producers as to whether Cooter should have a beard or not). L.B. appeared in the episodes \"Follow that Still '', \"Duke of Duke '' \"The Runaway '', before Jones returned to the series; the episode \"Grannie Annie '' also features another temporary Cooter replacement, Mickey Jones as B.B. Davenport. Ernie Lively also played a different character named \"Dobro Doolan '', a friend of Bo and Luke, in the first episode of the series, \"One Armed Bandits '' (where he was credited as Ernie Brown), and as a guard called Clyde in the later sixth - season episode \"The Ransom of Hazzard County ''. With Cooter 's temporary absence, it was never fully explained why one of his relations was suddenly running the garage in his place; and in a similar vein to Coy and Vance in the fifth season, both of these cousins of Cooter were very much clones of the original character, and were never mentioned before or after their temporary spells replacing the original character. Hughie Hogg Jeff Altman Boss Hogg 's young nephew, said to be as crooked as -- maybe even more crooked than -- Hogg. Dressed in an all - white suit just like his Uncle Boss, Hughie drove or was chauffeured around in a white VW Beetle with bull horns on the hood, similar to Boss Hogg 's Cadillac. Typically, Boss Hogg would call in Hughie once per season to come up with a particularly dastardly scheme to get rid of the Dukes. Hughie 's seemingly flawless plots would always end up in disaster, and Boss Hogg would end up throwing him out of Hazzard at the end of the episode. Despite this, Hogg would always give Hughie \"one last chance '' on his next appearance. On some later appearances, Hughie would worm is way back into Hazzard by coming up with a scheme and then persuading Hogg to go along with it, often by bribery. The character of Hughie was first introduced in the episode \"Uncle Boss '', produced as the second episode of the second season but not broadcast until the third season (for unknown reasons, and just several episodes prior to \"The Return of Hughie Hogg ''). By that time, Hughie had already been seen as Temporary Sheriff in the second - season episode \"Arrest Jesse Duke '' in which he appeared in a secondary role, written in at the last minute to cover Sheriff Rosco 's absence during James Best 's temporary boycott of the show. He acted somewhat out of character of his usual conniving self in the episode, due to being given most of Rosco 's lines. Like the two Hazzard County deputies, Hughie has eyes for Daisy Duke, but his feelings are merely of a selfish lustful nature; Daisy despises Hughie, and thus the only reason that she 'll ever appear to return Hughie 's interest is merely to charm him into relaxing his guard or lure him away from a certain area till other townspeople can prepare to act against him, thus preventing him from subjecting Hazzard County to additional corruption. Wayne / Norris Roger Torrey One of Hughie 's loyal duo of henchman. Played by the same actor but with different names on different occasions. Floyd / Barclay Pat Studstill The other of Hughie 's duo of henchman. He and Norris were both bigger than Bo and Luke, but nonetheless struggled in fights against them. Again played by the same actor, but with different names on different occasions. Emery Potter Charlie Dell Emery Potter is the part - time Hazzard County registrar and chief teller of the Hazzard Bank. Emery is a meek, soft - spoken man with a low tolerance for anything exciting. He is a friend of the Dukes, and sometimes falls under Hogg 's crooked schemes simply because he is too timid to stand up for himself. First seen in the second - season episode \"People 's Choice '', the character made several return appearances across the seasons. He has also served as Temporary Deputy on occasion. Dr. Henry \"Doc '' Petticord Patrick Cranshaw Hazzard County 's ancient, long - serving physician. Miz (Emma) Tisdale Nedra Volz The postmistress of the Hazzard Post Office, Miz Tisdale (\"Emma '' to Jesse Duke) was an elderly woman who drove a motorcycle and had a huge crush on Uncle Jesse because they knew each - other long ago. She was also a reporter for the Hazzard Gazzette. Sheriff Edward Thomas \"Big Ed '' Little Don Pedro Colley The hulking chief law enforcement officer (driving a 1975 Plymouth Fury patrol car) of neighboring Chickasaw County, and the only recurring character in the series played by a black actor. Sheriff Little had a tendency to punch and kick fenders and doors off of cars he wrecked, in anger. He was also not afraid to pull out his trusty 12 - gauge shotgun and open fire. He is also a Left hander Police officer, The ill - tempered sheriff hated Bo, Luke, Daisy, Coy, Vance, Uncle Jesse, Cooter, Enos and Cletus immensely and they were well aware that Bo and Luke were not allowed to enter his county. Sheriff Little was constantly irritated by the bumbling performance of Rosco and the crookedness of Hogg, although he thought highly of Enos; Little was strict, by - the - book, and a competent law officer, everything that Sheriff Rosco was not (although he too had little luck in capturing Bo and Luke). He had a wife named Rachel and also a daughter. Before Sheriff Little was introduced, in the third - season episode \"My Son, Bo Hogg '', several first and second - season episodes saw several similar tough - as - nails Sheriffs from adjoining counties. Mr. Rhuebottom John Wheeler A local store owner, seen occasionally from the fourth - season episode \"Pin the Tail on the Dukes '' onwards.

As late as 1960, the two crops accounted for 67 % of the exports from the region. Though the two were grown in similar regions, they tended not to be distributed together. The United Fruit Company based its business almost entirely on the banana trade, because the coffee trade proved too difficult to control.

At the end of the party, a \"queen '' is chosen to receive a kiss on the cheek from Tamaki. However, just as Kanako is chosen as the queen, the twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin announce that Haruhi will be giving the kiss.

Their attempts, including Tamaki disguising himself as Haruhi, fail miserably until Kyoya Ootori steps in with a doctor who promises not to reveal her secret. Meanwhile, a disoriented doctor named Yabu (or Quack) is searching for his daughter and is accused of \"making a pass '' at one of the female students. Dr. Yabu is distraught at the accusations and equally distraught that his wife and daughter left him due to financial problems. Kyoya points out that if the man 's family is really that poor, the girl would be attending Ouran Public High School, rather than the prestigious and very expensive Ouran Academy. Tamaki gives him directions, even though he might get hurt later, it 's up to him to find out if his daughter and he can still have a relationship. Haruhi is quietly impressed and decides to stick with the Host Club a bit longer. 04 \"Attack of the Lady Manager!

Kyoya is not given a character since Renge deems him already perfect. Eventually, Renge makes a movie featuring the Host Club, with each host acting out their new roles. She enlists two students to play villains in the movie; however, since the students take offence at being typecast as villains based on their appearance they push Renge away. As Haruhi attempts to protect Renge she dislodges a contact lens, causing her to appear as if she 's crying. Tamaki hurries over, angry at the thought that someone has hurt her, and confronts the two now terrified students. Haruhi finally helps Renge understand that accepting people for who they are is what 's important and not who you assume or want them to be. Kyoya breaks the camera to prevent the footage of Tamaki acting violently from ruining the Host Clubs reputation. Instead he edits the footage into a popular movie to sell to their customers. Renge switches her crush from Kyoya to Haruhi because of \"his '' bravery. 05 \"The Twins Fight!

This triggers a fight between the inseparable siblings, even making them dye their hair different colors (blue and pink) in order to be told apart. The feud between the twins carries into the classroom and later, the refectory where everyone sees them. Haruhi learns that the twins have never had a fight before and wonders if they 'll know when to stop. Back in Music Room 3, Kaoru threatens to use a Beelzenef curse doll obtained from Umehito Nekozawa, the president of the Black Magic Club, and threatens to write Hikaru 's name on it, completing the curse. Haruhi intervenes and snatches the Beelzenef doll from Kaoru, chastising them both for taking things too far, adding that if they do n't apologize immediately she will never let them visit her home. She then sees that Kaoru only wrote \"blank '' on the back and realizes the whole fight was a plot by the twins to be allowed to visit Haruhi 's home. With the twins back together they continue playing the game, which Haruhi wins yet again. The twins wonder if maybe Haruhi is the only person who could truly understand them. 06 \"The Grade School Host is the Naughty Type!

They discover that Shiro has a crush on a girl called Hina who will soon be moving away and that she and Shiro were supposed to play a piano piece together, though Shiro is woefully unprepared, having spent most of his time watching her with adoration while she played alone.

The Host Club ends up hosting a command performance which allows Shiro and Hina to have a small concert in the Host Club lounge. 07 \"Jungle Pool SOS!

Haruhi and Mori separate from the rest of the group to look for him, and Mori carries Haruhi due to the fact that she 's creeped out by the jungle animals. Haruhi wonders about Honey and Mori 's relationship and the twins explain that they 're cousins by marriage but traditionally Mori 's family had been the servants of Honey 's family for generations. Meanwhile, Kyoya hires his family 's private police force (The Black Onion Squad) to look for Honey and arrest any suspicious people. The squad mistakes Haruhi for Honey and Mori as a suspicious person. Honey swings in on a vine, amazing Haruhi with his martial arts ability before he subdues the guards who apologize profusely for attacking Haruhi and Mori and claim to be honored to be beaten by the great Mitsukuni Haninozuka, nationally - renowned martial artist.

Hikaru and Kaoru devise a game to find out what Haruhi is afraid of. Kyoya hypes up the competition between Tamaki and the twins by offering up photos of Haruhi in middle school, refusing to explain where he got them. In turn, the hosts attempt to scare Haruhi, unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, Haruhi confronts two drunken thugs who threaten some of the girls and she 's tossed from a cliff into the ocean. Tamaki rescues, then rebukes Haruhi for being so reckless, causing them to angrily avoid each other for the remainder of the day. Seeing that Haruhi does n't understand verbal messages, Kyoya threatens to molest Haruhi to demonstrate how physically vulnerable she actually is and is successful in having her realize what everyone was worried about. Tamaki wins the competition discreetly in the end, finding out she has Astraphobia, the fear of thunder and lightning, when he sees Haruhi hide inside a wardrobe during a thunderstorm. The rest of the Host Club walks in just in time to see Tamaki covering Haruhi 's ears and eyes to help deal with the phobia and accuse him of trying to trick Haruhi into an S&M situation. Tamaki is devastated Haruhi now thinks he is a pervert. 09 \"A Challenge from Lobelia Girls ' Academy!

Along with two of her clubmates, they disparage the Host Club and men in numerous ways, revealing their lesbian natures and belief in female superiority. Tamaki 's half - Japanese / half - French background is revealed and Haruhi learns that one of her personal belongings was auctioned off on the Host Club 's online auction site and angrily leaves the club for the day. Convinced that Haruhi might be upset enough to transfer to St. Lobelia, the boys dress up as girls to show Haruhi that she can be around boys and girls at the same time if she remains at Ouran. Haruhi finds this hilarious, but shares that she came to Ouran Academy for a specific reason and never planned on leaving. The Zuka Club girls leave but refuse to give up, warning the club that they will be back for Haruhi. 10 \"A Day in the Life of the Fujioka Family! '' \"Fujioka - ke no Nichij\u014d '' (\u85e4\u5ca1 \u5bb6 \u306e \u65e5\u5e38) June 6, 2006 Tamaki awakens from a nightmare in which he sees Haruhi living in poverty. With this in mind, he enlists the other hosts and they go to the apartment complex where Haruhi lives. Haruhi resigns herself to letting them in and serving them tea. Tamaki warns the twins not to insult Haruhi 's commoner lifestyle but ends up offending her himself. When Honey asks Haruhi to prepare lunch, she agrees. They all prepare to go to the commoners supermarket, but Tamaki lags behind to pay his respects to the shrine of Haruhi 's late mother, Kotoko. He and Haruhi exchange a moment of empathy but he trips and falls on top of Haruhi just as her Cross-dressing father (Ryouji \"Ranka '' Fujioka) arrives home from work. Upon seeing his daughter underneath Tamaki, he dislodges Tamaki from Haruhi face first into the wall. Later, he reveals that he 's a professional transvestite named \"Ranka '' and has been in contact with Kyoya ever since Haruhi became a host. Haruhi is thoroughly annoyed at everybody and leaves to go shopping by herself. Ranka invites the hosts to stalk Haruhi with him, partly to keep an eye on his daughter and partly so that he can be seen publicly with a group of handsome boys. Tamaki tries to impress Ranka with his appreciation for Haruhi, but Ranka only refers to him as \"the enemy. '' 11 \"Big Brother is a Prince! '' \"Onii - chama wa \u014cji - sama '' (\u304a \u5144 \u3061\u3083 \u307e \u306f \u738b\u5b50 \u69d8) June 13, 2006 A small girl, Kirimi Nekozawa, wanders into Ouran Academy searching for her older brother who attends the school. Her brother is Umehito Nekozawa. She labels the Host Club as \"a reverse harem, '' surrounded by \"debauchery '' which the hosts find startling given her young age. When Kirimi sees Tamaki 's blond hair, she mistakes him for Umehito. Two servants from the Nekozawa household appear to retrieve her and, while with the hosts, explain that Kirimi is afraid of the dark while Umehito is afraid of the light. With his black cloak, black wig and Beelzenef cat puppet, Umehito accidentally frightens Kirimi who clings to Tamaki, causing Umehito to leave, dejected. After the siblings leave, Tamaki enlists the help of Renge to coach Nekozawa into become the princely figure his sister is convinced that he is. She lives her life waiting for her princely brother to save her from the monster in her house, who is actually Nekozawa in his cloak and wig, having to cover his skin and hair due to photophobia. Tamaki and Renge help him to learn to act princely and to avoid occult references, as well as help him give up his cloak and wig, convincing him that his phobia is just psychological. Eventually this leads to him saving Kirimi from a large unfriendly cat, since she also has ailurophobia, the fear of cats, and convinces her of his bravery. Despite temporarily overcoming his photophobia, Umehito eventually succumbs to his skin 's sensitivity to sunlight and collapses. This makes the Host Club believe that they were unsuccessful when, in reality, the Nekozawa siblings have forged a bond that transcends appearances. 12 \"Honey 's Three Bitter Days '' \"Han\u012b - senpai no Amakunai Mikkakan '' (\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc \u5148\u8f29 \u306e \u7518\u304f \u306a\u3044 \u4e09 \u65e5\u9593) June 20, 2006 A brief introductory bit has Honey 's adored stuffed bunny, Usa - chan, stained with tea, with Tamaki and the twins terrified of Honey 's reaction when he wakes up. Haruhi learns more about Honey 's bad temper if woken from sleep too early and his martial arts abilities that once caused a major diplomatic crisis between Japan and America, although Mori is able to defuse the entire situation with a few words. During club hours, Honey experiences sudden tooth pain and Mori finds that he has a cavity; the number one rule until the cavity is fixed is no desserts or snacks. A very depressed Honey attempts many strategies to obtain sweets, but to no avail. He ultimately takes his frustration out on Mori by judo - throwing him, as Mori is being the strictest with him. Haruhi realizes that Mori wanted to be punished by Honey because he blames himself for not telling Honey to brush his teeth. When Honey hears this, he 's very sorry and they make amends. A few days later, Honey 's cavity is repaired, thereby allowing him to eat desserts and snacks again, which makes him happy but Kyoya, very unhappy; the reason being that purchasing all Honey 's snacks cost the club money and Kyoya, after all, is the \"Shadow King '' who keeps the club afloat financially while Tamaki is the obvious \"King '' who keeps the guests happy. 13 \"Haruhi in Wonderland!

She meets Shiro Takaoji as a mouse, Kyoya Ootori as the Caterpillar, and Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin as twin Cheshire Cats. She seems to recognize something about all of them in her dream like the fact that the \"one '' Chesire cat is actually the twins or that Kyoya always writes in a black notebook. She also runs into a Mad Hatter that resembles Tamaki, a March Hare that resembles Honey and a Dormouse that resembles Mori, as well as a Duchess that resembles Renge, a Dodo that resembles Kanako and a Cook that resembles Ayanokoji. Throughout the dream, they all try to give Haruhi advice, but she only realizes it when she stands before the royal court in defense of the Duchess. The king turns out to be Ryouji and the queen, Kotoko (her late mother), who tells Haruhi to enjoy her life as it occurs instead of just focusing on the future. Haruhi wakes up with tears in her eyes and sees the Host Club dressed up in costumes similar to the ones they wore in her dream. She ends the episode by commenting on how the Host Club has too much fun, but her smile declares that she 's glad that it does. 14 \"Covering The Famous Host Club!

The newspaper club president, Akira Komatsuzawa, is especially interested in finding something to use against the Host Club 's president, Tamaki, because he believes that Tamaki is using his parents ' power to control the popular students, and he wants to exploit that information for his own benefit. Hard as they try as they observe the Host Club playing outdoor children 's games, they 're unable to \"scoop '' evidence about Tamaki 's non-existent dark side. Akira decides he 'll simply make up something just to smear Tamaki, but is thwarted by the Host Club. When Haruhi inquires about Tamaki 's parents, she learns for the first time that Tamaki 's father is the Chairman of Ouran Academy, the benefactor of her scholarship. 15 \"The Refreshing Battle of Karuizawa!

She feels guilty at first for not saying anything about it to the rest of the Host Club. Tamaki meanwhile freaks out because he ca n't find Haruhi and, believing she has been kidnapped, calls in the Host Club to locate her. Kyoya tells Tamaki that she went to Karuizawa for the summer. Still thinking that she was kidnapped Tamaki gets the Host Club to go and find her. Hikaru and Kaoru are surprised by the news and are desperate to find her. When the club arrives, a \"refreshment '' contest erupts when they realize there is only one remaining room at the pension and they all want to stay. The owner of the pension, Misuzu Sonoda, a cross dressing friend of Haruhi 's father, agrees to the contest because it entails getting chores done around the pension, as well as having the handsome hosts visible on her property to draw in more customers. Honey is disqualified as being too babyish which also eliminates Mori. The twins have the upper hand as Tamaki struggles to be refreshing. Kyoya sits out the competition but assists Tamaki, who charms Misuzu by playing the piano. In the end, however, it 's Hikaru and Kaoru who win by inadvertently demonstrating their \"brotherly love. '' The brothers share the room and in the morning, are grumpy and rude to Haruhi. Just then, a friend of Haruhi 's from middle school appears as a summertime delivery boy and reconnects with Haruhi. 16 \"Operation Haruhi and Hikaru 's First Date!

Kaoru wants to make up for Hikaru 's rude behaviour, so he offers to take Haruhi out on a date. Kaoru pretends to be sick for the date and has Hikaru go instead. He does so because he believes that Hikaru is interested in Haruhi but, being clumsy in genuine social situations, does n't know how to act properly and hopes Haruhi can help him learn how to think of others first. During their date, Hikaru runs off due to another encounter with Arai, and a thunderstorm occurs. Worried about Haruhi, Tamaki calls Hikaru, accuses him of selfishness, and tells him that Haruhi is afraid of thunder, accidentally revealing Haruhi 's weakness. Acknowledging Tamaki 's words, Hikaru sets off to find her in the midst of the storm. In the end, Hikaru comforts Haruhi, who is hiding from the thunder under the altar in a church, sitting beside her and giving her his headphones to drown out the sound. He apologizes for the way he acted and Haruhi forgives him. At the end, Kaoru remarks to Kyoya that Hikaru will not notice his feelings for Haruhi because he 's a dummy while Kyoya comments that their club is full of dummies. 17 \"Kyoya 's Reluctant Day Out! '' \"Ky\u014dya no Fuhon'i na Ky\u016bjitsu '' (\u93e1 \u591c \u306e \u4e0d \u672c\u610f \u306a \u4f11\u65e5) July 25, 2006 Kyoya, who is notoriously bad tempered in the morning, is dragged half asleep into a department store and accidentally abandoned by the Host Club, who aim to study the life of commoners, and therefore understand more about Haruhi. When he wakes up, Kyoya notices that he is without a wallet or a cell phone, and that he 's quite hungry. Luckily, he ends up meeting Haruhi there, alone, and they spend the day learning about one another. Kyoya reveals that he is the youngest of three sons of the Otori family and, as such, finds it a challenge to surpass his exemplary brothers in order to meet his father 's high expectations. While wandering around, they encounter a vendor who is advertising fake pottery as genuine artwork. A woman is about to purchase something from him when Kyoya steps in and reveals both his knowledge of art and the vendor 's trickery. Haruhi is impressed by his altruism in helping the woman but Kyoya claims he had an ulterior motive as the woman he helped is the wife of a very influential man, and her gratitude may be a benefit to the Otori family in the future. They reunite with the other hosts and find Tamaki has purchased a dog which he names Antoinette. As Haruhi leaves to go home, she comments to Kyoya that he really is a lot like Tamaki in his dedication to helping people even though he (Kyoya) pretends to not care. Kyoya is impressed, yet again, by her insight. 18 \"Chika 's \"Down with Honey '' Declaration! '' \"Chika - kun no Han\u012b Dat\u014d Sengen '' (\u30c1\u30ab \u541b \u306e \u30cf\u30cb\u30fc \u6253\u5012 \u5ba3\u8a00) August 1, 2006 Honey has a younger brother named Yasuchika \"Chika '' Haninozuka. Chika is known to hold a grudge against Honey because of Honey 's loli - shota lifestyle. Whenever they meet, family tradition demands a martial arts duel and, typically, Honey wins. Chika demands that Honey steer clear of him at school. After he leaves, Haruhi learns how Honey quit being the Captain of the Ouran Karate Club in order to join the Host Club. Tamaki insists that they help the brothers reunite and so, they go to the dojo where Chika is now Captain of the Karate Club. Chika confronts them outside and calls his brother an \"alien '' because Honey eats three whole cakes for dessert every night and holds a weekly midnight cakefest; this, without ever gaining weight. Honey apologizes to Chika for causing so much pain and suffering for him, but wo n't give up being true to himself. To settle the score, Honey and Chika have a martial arts duel, the stakes being that if Honey loses he will give up his weekly midnight cakefest. Mori is confident Honey will throw the fight for his brother but is devastated when Honey beats his brother soundly. In the end, Honey considers Haruhi 's opinion that if he loves cake more than his brother, he 's really a terrible person; and also Tamaki 's opinion that true strength means being true to yourself. Honey 's response is to hug Usa - chan tightly saying, \"I love you. '' 19 \"Lobelia Girls ' Academy Strikes Back! '' \"Roberia Jogakuin no Gyakush\u016b '' (\u30ed\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2 \u5973\u5b66\u9662 \u306e \u9006\u8972) August 8, 2006 The Lobelia girls finally manage to kidnap Haruhi and bring her to St. Lobelia Girls ' Academy where they dress her in uniform and invite her to join the Zuka Club because a fellow performer \"broke a leg '' and ca n't perform in their show that day. She refuses until she learns that Benibara 's late mother would be disappointed in Benibara for cancelling the show. Meanwhile, the Host Club freaks out when they visit Ryouji and learn that Haruhi is with the Lobelia girls. They infiltrate St. Lobelia, spy on Haruhi 's rehearsal and pretend to be fans of Lady Benibara in order to get close enough to Haruhi to rescue her. During the actual show, Tamaki overhears that there 's to be a \"kiss scene '' and when Benibara speaks lines about revenge, the spotlight shines on the Hosts and Ryouji. Kyoya, in the meantime, has charmed his way into the control room and taken command of the technical console, having the image of Haruhi kissing Kanako at the Dance Party projected onto a large onstage screen for the world to see, thereby thwarting Benibara 's hope to steal Haruhi 's first kiss. The episode ends with the Zuka Club and the Hosts chasing Haruhi around the stage and everyone slipping on banana peels. 20 \"The Door the Twins Opened! '' \"Futago ga Aketa Tobira '' (\u53cc\u5b50 \u304c \u3042\u3051 \u305f \u6249) August 15, 2006 A prequel that tells the story of how Hikaru and Kaoru are convinced to join the Host Club. As children, they had a maid they adored but who, in reality, was a thief trying to rob the family safe in the middle of the night. The toddler twins tell her that if she can tell who is who between them, they 'll give her the combination to the safe (which they keep hidden in their piggy bank). Unable to tell them apart, the maid breaks open the piggy bank after they fall asleep and robs the family. As she descends a rope ladder from the upper stories of the mansion, the twins wake up and go to her, asking why she broke her promise. She says that she ca n't tell them apart and, perhaps, no one ever will. This leads to the twins dysfunctional view of others being untrustworthy unless they can tell the twins apart; which of course, no one can. When they meet Tamaki in middle school, he asks them to join the Host Club and they agree, provided Tamaki can figure out which twin is which, giving him a month to do so. Over time, they grow bored and annoyed with Tamaki and tell him to get lost. They go back to being mean and selfish, playing tricks on girls who like them and isolating themselves from others. Tamaki, despite being dismissed, remains determined and finally figures out which twin is which. They dislike his reason of \"intuition, '' but Tamaki helps Hikaru and Kaoru to understand that it 's okay to be who they are, just as they are; but if they keep themselves shut off from everyone, they 'll never ever meet the person who really can tell them apart. The first host club meeting is held on Opening Day and the twins enter the Host Club, as usual, together. 21 \"Until the Day it Becomes a Pumpkin! '' \"Itsuka Kabocha ni naru Hi made '' (\u3044\u3064\u304b \u30ab\u30dc\u30c1\u30e3 \u306b \u306a\u308b \u65e5 \u307e\u3067) August 22, 2006 Haruhi 's Class 1 - A has a Halloween event called \"The Halloween Test - of - Courage Tournament, '' in which teams do their best to scare each other. The losing team will be featured on the front page of the school newsletter with the headline, \"The Captains of All Cowards. '' Class 1 - A president, Kazukiyo Soga, is n't so keen on this idea, as he reveals to Haruhi that he has nyctophobia, a fear of the dark. He begs for Haruhi 's help and wishes her to keep it a secret, but the twins find out and the four of them become Team B. On the night of the event, Soga reveals that he has a crush on Momoka Kurakano, Class 1 - A 's vice-president and the twins reconsider their teasing of him because he 's \"pure - hearted. '' Nekozawa and the rest of the Host Club join forces to scare Team B and use Tamaki dressed as the Clocktower Witch to terrify them. Haruhi and Hikaru run in one direction, tripping a net that traps them above ground while Kaoru and Soga run in the opposite direction only to be shoved and locked in an empty room by Kuretake and Kadomatsu, the Nekozawa family servants. There, Kaoru muses to Soga about \"the carriage being turned back to a pumpkin '' which Soga does n't understand. To Kaoru, though, it means that Tamaki 's dream of keeping everyone together must end one day and that his \"special relationship '' to his twin, Hikaru, must also end. Haruhi and Hikaru manage to break free of the trap courtesy of Haruhi 's hidden sewing kit and they reunite with Kaoru and Soga and, eventually, all of Class 1 - A. Nekozawa frightens everyone by casting a shadow of Beelzenef on the domed skylight, thus earning Class 1 - A the title of \"The Captains of all Cowards. '' 22 \"Mori - senpai Has an Apprentice Candidate! '' \"Mori - senpai ni Deshiiri Shigan '' (\u30e2\u30ea \u5148\u8f29 \u306b \u5f1f\u5b50\u5165\u308a \u5fd7\u9858) August 29, 2006 When the son of a gangster, Ritsu Kasanoda, seeks out Mori for tips on how to change his scary appearance and gain friends, the Host Club immediately jumps at the opportunity to change his image, making many humorous mistakes along the way, including messing with Kasanoda 's name by calling him Casanova and Bossanova, as well as dressing him in ridiculous outfits. When Kasanoda meets Haruhi, he 's attracted to her which leads to confusion about his sexuality, since he believes her to be a boy. When two rival gang members attempt to hurt Kasanoda, Honey and Mori intervene. The thugs demand that Tetsuya Sendo, one of Kasanoda 's ' fellas, be returned but Tetsuya appears and demands they leave before sharing with the hosts how he came to serve his young lord. Kasanoda is touched by everyone 's good will and goes to find Haruhi, who is changing in Music Room 3 and, just like Tamaki, he learns about Haruhi 's gender by accident. 23 \"Tamaki 's Unwitting Depression! '' \"Tamaki no Mujikaku na Y\u016butsu '' (\u74b0 \u306e \u7121\u81ea\u899a \u306a \u6182\u9b31) September 5, 2006 After Kasanoda realizes that Haruhi is a girl he is terrified by the twins and Honey for seeing Haruhi in her underwear, which also puts Tamaki in a state of near permanent shock. Now able to accept his feelings for Haruhi, Kasanoda promises to keep her secret. His ' fellas are quite confused because they still think Haruhi is a boy. When Kasanoda next visits the Host Club as a customer, he requests Haruhi; and because the other guests also think Haruhi is a boy, they become quite excited about the Yaoi possibilities. Tamaki is still catatonic with shock about the thought of Haruhi marrying Kasanoda and living as a Mob Wife, whereas Kyoya is thrilled because attendance at the club is way, way up. The twins are furious with Tamaki for being useless in a crisis and Kyoya for being a \"money grubbing enabler ''. Kasanoda tries his best to tell Haruhi how he feels about her, but ca n't because of his shyness and also because to others he would be seen as gay, which he is not. Just as he plucks up the courage to tell Haruhi, she cuts him short and says that they 'll be great friends, causing the girls present to feel sorry for Kasanoda. They 're so moved by the moe drama of it that they rush to comfort him. Tamaki, however, confronts Kasanoda as an irate \"parent, '' but Kasanoda is blunt about Tamaki not being Haruhi 's father, a fantasy Tamaki has held from the outset in order to sublimate his own romantic feelings towards Haruhi. When Haruhi says Tamaki does act like her father, Tamaki rejoices and seizes the opportunity to reclaim his familial place in her life. Haruhi, herself, is oblivious to everything. 24 \"And so Kyoya Met Him! '' \"Soshite Ky\u014dya wa Deatta '' (\u305d\u3057\u3066 \u93e1 \u591c \u306f \u51fa\u4f1a\u3063 \u305f) September 12, 2006 Kyoya recalls when he first met Tamaki two years ago, and how he only became friends with him because his father, Yoshio Ootori, insisted that it would be good for business. Kyoya explains how he perceived his familial role at that time and set out to please his father by befriending the new transfer student, Tamaki Suoh. Tamaki first meets Kyoya, who is the class president representative of middle school homeroom. Kyoya initially puts up with Tamaki 's odd requests, travelling all over Japan while trying to wrap his head around the effluvient Tamaki, but can neither anticipate nor control him, which he finds eminently frustrating. One Sunday, Tamaki shows up at Kyoya 's house unannounced, but before Kyoya can politely eject him, he 's mesmerized by Tamaki 's soulful musicianship (as are the other three Ootori siblings). Afterwards, as they share tea, Tamaki manages to push every button Kyoya has, who snaps at him for not appreciating his easy path to his family 's patriarchy, whereas Kyoya, as the youngest son, has had to fight just to be acknowledged by his father. Tamaki parries by telling Kyoya that the only one holding Kyoya back is himself. At that point, Kyoya sees the ironic truth and laughs, demolishing the barriers between them and setting them up for a true friendship. Later that year, they sit under a kotatsu together and make plans to form the Host Club. 25 \"The Host Club Declares Dissolution! '' \"Hosuto - bu Kaisan Sengen '' (\u30db\u30b9\u30c8 \u90e8 \u89e3\u6563 \u5ba3\u8a00) September 19, 2006 It 's time for the annual Ouran Fair, a chance for the school 's clubs to showcase student leadership skills and a talent for upward mobility. The Host Club has won the honor of using the Main Salon to entertain their visitors and they manage to charm every one of them, except for a mysterious diva who watches everything through opera glasses. Tamaki 's father, Yuzuru Suoh, meets Haruhi for the first time and Haruhi notes that while they do n't look alike, they share a flair for flirting. Yoshio Ootori, Kyoya 's father, slaps him for wasting his time on such a frivolous club. Haruhi defends Kyoya, but begins to see the down - side of wealth. Her education in this regard is furthered when Tamaki 's grandmother, Shizue Suoh, arrives. She is curt and dismissive to Tamaki but introduces him to the Lady \u00c9clair, the mysterious diva who his grandmother commands he chaperone. \u00c9clair is revealed to be wealthy and powerful, but also haughty and selfish. Tamaki ends up engaged to \u00c9clair on his grandmothers orders and the Host Club is declared dissolved as of the end of the festival, at which point Tamaki will leave Japan with \u00c9clair. Haruhi also learns of Tamaki 's mother, who was his fathers mistress and not his wife, and how Tamaki 's entrance into the prestigious Suoh family was conditional on Tamaki never being allowed to see his mother again. 26 \"This is Our Ouran Fair! '' \"Kore ga Oretachi no \u014cran - sai '' (\u3053\u308c\u304c \u4ffa \u305f\u3061 \u306e \u685c\u862d \u796d) September 26, 2006 Lady \u00c9clair pays off Haruhi 's debt, meaning she 's able to leave the Host Club. She declines to leave, realizing that she has made friends in the Host Club and does n't want to lose them. Kyoya learns that Tamaki is on his way to the airport to leave for France with Lady \u00c9clair. The hosts race against time to recover Tamaki but find that Yoshio Ootori has ordered the Black Onion Squad to keep them from interfering. Haruhi, Hikaru and Kaoru end up using a horse - drawn carriage to pursue the couple while Kyoya, Honey and Mori stay behind to battle with the Ootori family police. Hikaru gets hurt in a carriage crash and Kaoru stays behind to care for him. Haruhi catches up to the car carrying Tamaki and \u00c9clair as they are both crossing a bridge. Haruhi begs Tamaki to return and reaches for his hand, but Tamaki is stopped by \u00c9clair. Haruhi falls from the carriage off the bridge. \u00c9clair, realizing where Tamaki 's heart truly lies, releases him and Tamaki thanks her before jumping from the car to save Haruhi. Lady \u00c9clair looks on and reveals that her favourite house maid, who often talks about her son who loves to play the piano, is actually Tamaki 's mother who she had planned to finally reunite with Tamaki. At the Ouran Ball, Haruhi dances with all the members of the Host Club. Yuzuru and Yoshio discuss their sons, with Yoshio revealing that the Ootori Company had been struggling financially until Kyoya, having worked for years to secretly develop multiple business deals, not only took ownership of the company out from under him, but allowed him to stay on as manager, basically outmanoeuvring his father to steal his company so he could then throw it back in his face as proof he did n't need the company to be happy. Both men agree to remain friends for the sake of their sons, instead arguing over whether Tamaki or Kyoya will one day marry Haruhi. The Host Club watches fireworks together. The final scene returns to the open doors of Music Room 3, rose petals swirling, as all seven hosts thank the viewers for watching and to remember that they 'll be waiting."

    "text": "Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod - free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula. The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster 's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina."

By reaching the milestone, he also became the first player to hit 30 and then 40 home runs in a single - season, breaking his own record of 29 from the 1919 season. Ruth subsequently became the first player to reach the 50 home run club on four occasions, repeating the achievement in 1921, 1927 and 1928. He remained the only player to accomplish this until Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa matched his feat in 1999 and 2001, respectively, thus becoming the only players to achieve four consecutive 50 home run seasons.

In most places, Know Nothingism lasted only a year or two before disintegrating because of weak local leaders, few publicly declared national leaders and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism, but was the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party."

While Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) might seem to be a network - layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete frames or packets to deliver to an endpoint.

Epiphytes take part in nutrient cycles and add to both the diversity and biomass of the ecosystem in which they occur like any other organism. They are an important source of food for many species. Typically, the older parts of a plant will have more epiphytes growing on them. Epiphytes differ from parasites in that epiphytes grow on other plants for physical support and do not necessarily negatively affect the host. An epiphytic organism that is not a plant is sometimes called an epibiont. Epiphytes are usually found in the temperate zone (e.g., many mosses, liverworts, lichens, and algae) or in the tropics (e.g., many ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads). Epiphyte species make good houseplants due to their minimal water and soil requirements.

Since the advent of the first commercially available devices in the mid-1980s the method has become popular owing to its ease of use, portability of the equipment. It is familiar in the consumer market as a simple instrument for estimating body fat. BIA actually determines the electrical impedance, or opposition to the flow of an electric current through body tissues which can then be used to estimate total body water (TBW), which can be used to estimate fat - free body mass and, by difference with body weight, body fat."

The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast. The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline, one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States. Under British rule, settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British. A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain; it was named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States."

The USSR was a Marxist -- Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and many organizations. It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino - Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the capitalist West, led by the United States, a federal republic with a two - party presidential system. The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally liberal democratic with a free press and independent organizations, but were economically and politically entwined with a network of banana republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World, most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies. Some major Cold War frontlines such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Congo were still Western colonies in 1947."

Similarly, anything having energy exhibits a corresponding mass m given by its energy E divided by the speed of light squared c2. Because the speed of light is a very large number in everyday units, the formula implies that even an everyday object at rest with a modest amount of mass has a very large amount of energy intrinsically. Chemical, nuclear, and other energy transformations may cause a system to lose some of its energy content (and thus some corresponding mass), releasing it as the radiant energy of light or as thermal energy for example."

    "text": "India is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. The nation 's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the Hindu Kush mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at the similar latitudes. Simultaneously, the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture - laden southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India 's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate, into which fall seven climatic zones that, as designated by experts, are defined on the basis of such traits as temperature and precipitation. Groupings are assigned codes (see chart) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system."

    "text": "The Old Post Office, listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Old Post Office and Clock Tower and located at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., was begun in 1892, completed in 1899, and is a contributing property to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site. It was used as the city 's main General Post Office until 1914 at the beginning of World War I, succeeding an earlier 1839 edifice, G.P.O. of Classical Revival style, expanded in 1866 on F Street, which later was turned over to the Tariff Commission and several other agencies (today, the Hotel Monaco). The Pennsylvania Avenue 1899 landmark structure functioned primarily as an federal office building afterward, and was nearly torn down during the construction of the surrounding Federal Triangle complex in the 1920s. It was again threatened and nearly demolished in the 1970s to make way for proposals for the completion of the enveloping Federal Triangle complex of similar Beaux Arts styled architecture government offices, first begun in the 1920s and 30s."

    "text": "At first, indentured servants were used as the needed labor. These servants provided up to seven years of service in exchange for having their trip to Jamestown paid for by someone in Jamestown. Once the seven years was over, the indentured servant was free to live in Jamestown as a regular citizen. However, colonists began to see indentured servants as too costly, in part because the high mortality rate meant the force had to be resupplied. In 1619, Dutch traders brought African slaves taken from a Spanish ship to Jamestown; in North America, the Africans were also generally treated as indentured servants in the early colonial era."

    "text": "This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four - year period known as an Olympiad. There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities, and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Tokyo / Helsinki (summer) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen (winter) in 1940; and London (summer) and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (winter) in 1944. The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games. Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games: Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics, Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics, Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics."

    "text": "\"The Raven '' is a narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language, and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a talking raven 's mysterious visit to a distraught lover, tracing the man 's slow fall into madness. The lover, often identified as being a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further instigate his distress with its constant repetition of the word \"Nevermore ''. The poem makes use of a number of folk, mythological, religious, and classical references."

Steadman was offered the role without auditions or screen tests. Elizabeth 's four sisters, whose ages ranged between 15 and 22, were cast to look dissimilar from each other. Susannah Harker portrayed Elizabeth 's beautiful older sister Jane, who desires to only see good in others. Lucy Briers, Polly Maberly, and Julia Sawalha played Elizabeth 's younger sisters -- the plain Mary, the good - natured but flighty and susceptible Kitty, and frivolous and headstrong Lydia. Being 10 years older than 15 - year - old Lydia, Julia Sawalha, of Absolutely Fabulous fame, had enough acting experience to get the role without screen tests. Joanna David and Tim Wylton appeared as the Gardiners, Elizabeth 's maternal aunt and uncle. David Bamber played the sycophantic clergyman, Mr Collins, a cousin of Mr Bennet. Lucy Scott portrayed Elizabeth 's best friend and Mr Collins 's wife, Charlotte Lucas, and David Bark - Jones portrayed Lt. Denny."

NFL team owners voted 31 -- 1 to approve the move, which was announced at the annual league meetings in Phoenix, Arizona on March 27, 2017. The Raiders became the third NFL franchise to relocate in the 2010s, following the Rams ' move from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles, California on January 12, 2016, and the Chargers ' move from San Diego, California to Los Angeles on January 12, 2017.

It is a common misconception that the Jordan 1 was banned however, it was indeed the Nike Air Ship. After the Nike Air Ship was banned, Michael Jordan and Nike introduced the Jordan 1 in color ways with more white such as the \"Chicago '' color way and the \"Black Toe '' color way. They used the Nike Air Ship 's banning as a promotional tool in advertisements hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage for the Jordan 1 and that whoever wore them had a certain edginess associated with outlaw activities."

It occurred following the passage of a strong cold front, in combination with a high - pressure area situated over the Mississippi River Valley. As a result, cold air spewed across Florida, causing both snow flurries and record low temperatures. Most notably, the weather system brought snow flurries (seen in the air, but not on the ground) as far south as Homestead on January 19. No snow had ever been reported in south Florida before or since. Damage was most significant to agriculture, as major losses occurred to Citrus fruits and tender vegetables. Statewide, agricultural damage from the cold wave totaled to $350 million (1977 USD), and losses overall totaled to $2 billion (1977 USD). One fatality occurred due to an automobile accident in Central Florida, which was related to the cold wave."

This explosion was the most powerful in a series of eruptions from 1914 through 1917. Lassen Peak and Mount St. Helens were the only two volcanoes in the contiguous United States to erupt during the 20th century. Lassen Volcanic National Park was created in Tehama County, California, to preserve the devastated areas as they were, for future observation and study, and to preserve the nearby volcanic features."

These electors then in turn cast direct votes, known as electoral votes, for President and Vice President. The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes for President or Vice President (currently, at least 270 out of a total of 538) is then elected to that office. If no candidate receives an absolute majority for President, the House of Representatives chooses the President; if no one receives a majority for Vice President, then the Senate chooses the Vice President."

'' Eyal Gordin Terri Minsky October 27, 2017 (2017 - 10 - 27) 113 -- 201 1.62 Andi talks to Bowie about proposing to Bex, while Cyrus introduces Iris as his girlfriend to Andi and Buffy, and Jonah invites Andi, Cyrus and Buffy to a pizza party for the Space Otters. At first, Andi does not want to go to the party, but later changes her mind after talking with Bex. Following the party, Jonah reveals to Andi that he broke up with Amber for good, though Andi had some idea prior to the party when he returned the bracelet she made for him. Andi gives Jonah back the bracelet and gets serious about being with him. While Cyrus is somewhat happy about seeing Andi and Jonah together again, he reveals to Buffy that he is also unhappy because he has romantic feelings for Jonah. Bowie comes over to Andi and Bex 's apartment with a pizza and, with Andi 's help, finally asks Bex to marry him. Bex 's response is simply \"um... '', but Andi is hopeful she will eventually say yes. Later, while at work, Bex receives another pizza from Bowie, who is also hopeful she will accept his proposal. As Andi and her friends discover Amber as a waitress at The Spoon, Andi tells Buffy about how that is making her uncomfortable but also how nervous she is around Jonah. Buffy thinks Andi is not ready for a serious relationship yet. While the two are talking, Jonah is with Amber outside, which further upsets Andi. Although Jonah says nothing is going on, Buffy warns him not to hurt Andi, causing him to leave the diner. Andi later talks to Jonah and wants their relationship to grow without Amber standing in the way. After having some time to think about Bowie 's proposal, Bex reveals to Andi that she is not going to marry him. Guest stars: Stoney Westmoreland as Ham, Trent Garrett as Bowie, Emily Skinner as Amber, Chelsea T. Zhang as Brittany, Molly Jackson as Iris Note: This is a double - length special episode. 14 \"Chinese New Year '' Eyal Gordin Elena Song November 3, 2017 (2017 - 11 - 03) 202 1.66 Andi is disappointed about Bex saying no to Bowie 's marriage proposal and wants Bex to tell Bowie as soon as possible, as he is unaware. With the approach of the Chinese New Year, and Andi and Bex 's aunt Mei and cousin Ronald coming over to Celia 's house, the news will have to wait. Andi invites Jonah to the new year event, but his not understanding the customs puts Celia on edge, as well as the idea of Andi even having a boyfriend. Meanwhile, Celia wants to show Mei that she can successfully host a Chinese New Year feast and is quite appreciative of Bowie 's contributions for the occasion. After Bowie announces that he may have some good news to share, Celia uses the opportunity to make the event special, until Andi hints to Bowie what she already knows and announces to the rest that Bex and Bowie are not getting married. Bowie is saddened by this and leaves. With track season over, Buffy decides to try out for basketball, but with no girls ' team at Jefferson Middle School, she signs up for the boys ' team. After some practice with Marty, Buffy lets him know how confident she is of making the team, despite her actually being nervous. She feels she needs to outperform the boys to secure a spot. Andi continues to be upset that Bex let Bowie go, but when finding something to eat, she rediscovers that picture which Bex tore up, making her even more upset. She wants to know whether the person in that picture is the reason behind Bex 's decision not to marry Bowie. Guest stars: Freda Foh Shen as Mei, Stoney Westmoreland as Ham, Trent Garrett as Bowie, Garren Stitt as Marty, Alan Ko as Ronald 15 \"Friends Like These '' Adam Weissman Phil Baker November 10, 2017 (2017 - 11 - 10) 203 1.40 Andi grows suspicious when Amber starts having a normal conversation with her. Jonah tells Andi that Amber just wants to be friends, but Andi thinks Amber has not gotten over Jonah. Andi, Cyrus and Buffy try another hangout place to avoid Amber at The Spoon. Meanwhile, Buffy and Marty go through tryouts to make the basketball team, but Buffy gets annoyed by TJ, the team 's captain. Despite feeling she will not make the team because of him, Buffy shares the good news with Andi and Cyrus when she does. Marty fails to make the team but is happy for Buffy. Cyrus and Iris spend an evening together at her house and watch a movie, but he becomes uncomfortable following a kiss with her and decides to leave. Andi finds out more about the man in the picture Bex tore up, an ex-boyfriend named Gabriel. Bex has trouble letting him go and tells Andi he is the reason she is insecure about marrying anyone, including Bowie. Andi helps Bex find closure with Gabriel by placing his picture with those of her other ex-boyfriends in her box of memories, which leads to them taking out Bowie 's picture.

Secession was declared by its supporters in Missouri and Kentucky, but did not become effective as it was opposed by their pro-Union state governments. This secession movement brought about the American Civil War. The position of the Union was that the Confederacy was not a sovereign nation -- and never had been, but that \"the Union '' was always a single nation by intent of the states themselves, from 1776 onward -- and thus that a rebellion had been initiated by individuals. Historian Bruce Catton described President Abraham Lincoln 's April 15, 1861, proclamation after the attack on Fort Sumter, which defined the Union 's position on the hostilities:"

A bull rope is a fiber rope wrapped around the chest of the bull directly behind the bull 's front legs, which the rider grips while riding. If the rider does this, it is a qualified ride. If the rider is bucked off before eight seconds, it is a no score. In most bull riding circuits, four judges mark scores for the rider and the bull. Two judges score the rider based on their ability up to 25 points each for up to a total of 50 points. The other two judges score the bull on his bucking performance for up to 25 points each for a total of up to 50 points. Thus, the ride is scored up to 100 points. Most professional riders score between the mid-70s and high 80s. American bull riding has been called \"the most dangerous eight seconds in sports. ''"

After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, and that she had been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3 -- 2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4 -- 3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a duty of care to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case."

However, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have statutory laws requiring a person receiving a tattoo be 18 years of age or older. This is partially based on the legal principle that a minor can not enter into a legal contract or otherwise render informed consent for a procedure. Most states permit a person under the age of 18 to receive a tattoo with permission of a parent or guardian, but some states outright prohibit tattooing under a certain age regardless of permission, with the exception of medical necessity (such as markings placed for radiation therapy)."

It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule. The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing Bowman 's capsule. The renal tubule extends from the capsule. The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen. A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney. Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers: the endothelial cells of the capillary wall, its basement membrane, and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule. The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule. As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule, it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule: water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged (some are added, others are removed); first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules, and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary. This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances. At the end of the tubule, the remaining fluid -- urine -- exits: it is composed of water, metabolic waste, and toxins."

    "text": "Glycolysis is an oxygen independent metabolic pathway, meaning that it does not use molecular oxygen (i.e. atmospheric oxygen) for any of its reactions. However the products of glycolysis (pyruvate and NADH + H) are sometimes metabolized using atmospheric oxygen. When molecular oxygen is used for the metabolism of the products of glycolysis the process is usually referred to as aerobic, whereas if no oxygen is used the process is said to be anaerobic. Thus, glycolysis occurs, with variations, in nearly all organisms, both aerobic and anaerobic. The wide occurrence of glycolysis indicates that it is one of the most ancient metabolic pathways. Indeed, the reactions that constitute glycolysis and its parallel pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, occur metal - catalyzed under the oxygen - free conditions of the Archean oceans, also in the absence of enzymes. Glycolysis could thus have originated from chemical constraints of the prebiotic world."

The Act of Supremacy of 1534 confirmed the King 's status as having supremacy over the church and required the nobility to swear an oath recognising Henry 's supremacy. By 1536, Henry had broken with Rome, seized the church 's assets in England and declared the Church of England as the established church with himself as its head. Henry 's daughter, Queen Mary I, a staunch Catholic, attempted to restore the English church 's allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555. Her half - sister, the Protestant Elizabeth I, took the throne in 1558 and the next year, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy of 1559 that restored the original act. The new Oath of Supremacy that nobles were required to swear gave the Queen 's title as Supreme Governor of the church rather than Supreme Head, to avoid the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or usurping Christ, whom the Bible explicitly identifies as Head of the Church."

    "text": "Natural gas was discovered accidentally in ancient China, as it resulted from the drilling for brines. The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt. Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BC (possibly even 1000 BC). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil salt water to extract the salt, in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan. The world 's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825. By 2009, 66 000 km3 (or 8 %) had been used out of the total 850 000 km3 of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400 km3 of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2 -- 3 % could result in currently recoverable reserves lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years."

This included warships and warplanes, along with other weaponry. The policy was signed into law on March 11, 1941 and ended overnight without prior warning when the war against Japan ended.

Some transport ships were returned to the US after the war, but practically all the items sent out were used up or worthless in peacetime.

With the success of Vincent in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30 - minute television special. Over the years, Burton 's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, he made a development deal with Disney. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney released the film through its Touchstone Pictures banner because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids ''."

    "text": "The Fundamental Duties of citizens were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the Constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defence. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. In case of violation of fundamental duties enshrined in the constitution by a citizen, it amounts to contempt of the constitution which is punishable under Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Supreme court has ruled that these fundamental duties can also help the court to decide the constitutionality of a law passed by the legislature. There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 51A brings the Indian Constitution into conformity with these treaties."

    "text": "\"Lady Jane '' was written and composed by Jagger in early 1966 after reading the then controversial book Lady Chatterley 's Lover, which uses the term \"Lady Jane '' to mean female genitalia. According to Jagger, \"the names (in the song) are historical, but it was really unconscious that they should fit together from the same period. '' At the time, it was widely thought that an inspiration for the song was Jane Ormsby - Gore, daughter of David Ormsby - Gore, former British ambassador in Washington, who later married Michael Rainey, founder of the Hung on You boutique in Chelsea that was frequented by the Stones. Its most impactful development was by Jones, no longer the principal musical force for the band, searching for methods to improve upon The Rolling Stones ' musical textures. He expressed an intrigue in incorporating culturally diverse instruments into the band 's music, investigating the sitar, koto, marimba, and testing electronics. In the press Jones talked about applying the Appalachian dulcimer into compositions, although he seemed uncertain of the instrument, saying \"It 's an old English instrument used at the beginning of the century ''. The dulcimer was first brought to his attention in March 1966 when Jones began listening to recordings of Richard Fari\u00f1a. The influence of these recordings would manifest itself in Aftermath, where Jones performed with the dulcimer on two tracks, \"I Am Waiting '' and, more distinctively, \"Lady Jane ''. This later contributed to Jones 's status as an early pioneer in world music, and effectively shifted the band from blues rock to a versatile pop group."

    "text": "The president is elected by the members of Parliament for a two - and - a-half - year term, meaning two elections per parliamentary term, hence two presidents may serve during any one Parliamentary term. Since the European People 's Party and Party of European Socialists began co-operating in the 1980s, they have had a tradition of splitting the two posts between them. In practice this means, in 2004 -- 2009 for example, that the People 's Party supported the Socialist candidate for president and, when his term expired in 2007, the Socialists supported the People 's Party candidate for president. This results in large majorities for presidents, although there are some exceptions: for example from 1999 -- 2004, under a People 's Party -- Liberal deal, the president for the second half of the term was a Liberal, rather than a Socialist."

It is a type of chemical messenger which transmits signals across a chemical synapse, such as a neuromuscular junction, from one neuron (nerve cell) to another \"target '' neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell. Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles in synapses into the synaptic cleft, where they are received by neurotransmitter receptors on the target cells. Many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as amino acids, which are readily available from the diet and only require a small number of biosynthetic steps for conversion. Neurotransmitters play a major role in shaping everyday life and functions. Their exact numbers are unknown, but more than 200 chemical messengers have been uniquely identified."

Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke 's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearms -- instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite -- or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit. Several other technicalities of their probation also came into play at various times."

Leo meets Grace Adler in Central Park while she is on her way to be artificially inseminated with gay best friend Will 's baby. After Will finds out that Leo and Grace are dating, they have their biggest fight of the entire series, in which Will tells Grace to move out. Thanks to Jack and Karen 's meddling, they forgive each other and Will accepts Grace 's relationship. In November, 2002, Grace and Leo are married at a spontaneous group ceremony in Central Park, which was supposed to be broadcast on The Today Show. It was later revealed in the storyline that the ceremony was not legal, but the two officially marry at a ceremony soon after. Leo and Grace 's relationship was a constant source of tension between Will and Grace, although they eventually achieved a certain accord with each other -- Leo even commenting to Will at one point that he considered himself essentially married to both of them due to his ability to accept their close relationship. Leo 's true first name is Marvin, as revealed by his mother at their wedding reception. According to The Nation Magazine, this was the first time in television history that a Jewish protagonist character had married inside the faith. Grace immediately realizes she does not know as much about Leo as she expected. Their marriage fails after less than two years, when Leo reveals that he had a one - night stand while working in Cambodia for Doctors Without Borders. Leo admits his affair to Will first. Will then refuses to help Leo break the news to Grace. After Leo comes clean about his affair, Grace briefly considers continuing their marriage, but quickly decides she wants a divorce. Leo reappears during season eight, a little over a year after the divorce in the storyline, in the episode \"Love Is in the Airplane. '' In the episode, he and Grace have a sexual encounter on an airplane after coincidentally ending up on the same flight to London, though Leo was to continue to Thailand. The result is Grace 's pregnancy, as discovered in the season eight episode \"The Definition of Marriage ''. A couple of months later Grace meets Leo, with the intention of telling him that she is pregnant with his baby, but he informs her that he is engaged to another woman, Kate. Consequently, Grace decides not to tell Leo about the pregnancy. In the series finale (May 2006) Leo tells a heavily pregnant Grace that he loves her. Leo has a job as a hospital researcher in Rome, Italy, and this is where Grace gives birth. After one year in Rome, Leo and Grace move back to Brooklyn, New York, where they raise their daughter, Laila, together. 11 years later in season 9 it was revealed that this was part of Karen 's dream. Bobbi Adler, Grace 's mother, was played by Debbie Reynolds. Bobbi is an actress and singer, although her performances are generally with the Schenectady Players and involve gender changing roles, in plays such as \"Death of a Salesperson '', \"The Music Person '' and \"Queen Lear ''. She has a constant desire to meddle in the love lives of her daughters, is the creator of the Adler family \"Told you so '' dance, and can always be relied upon to have a song for every occasion. She has, in the past, shown a perfect willingness for Will and Grace to get married. It is mentioned in Season 9 episode \"Rosario 's Quincea\u00f1era '' that she died. Martin Adler, Grace 's father, played by Alan Arkin and Robert Klein in Season 9. Portrayed by his family as the stereotypical Jewish patriarch, Martin shows genuine affection for Grace, although remarks he has made suggest Joyce is his favorite. He has been known to pinpoint Grace 's flaws without looking up from his Kojak and Baretta reruns. Janet Adler, Grace 's older sister, is played by Geena Davis and Mary McCormack in Season 9. Janet lives in a van and designs jewelry. Her nickname for Grace is \"Smudge ''. It is once implied that she has difficulties with her mother. In the episode \"Lows in the Mid-Eighties '', Will asks if Grace has another sister named Janet, to which Bobbi, Joyce, and Grace quickly answer \"No! '' Joyce Adler, Grace 's younger sister, is played by Sara Rue. It is suggested that Grace and Joyce had a not too friendly relationship growing up, and that Joyce was formerly a binge eater. She is often hostile to Grace, but one word from Will and she tends to giggle and act girlishly; it appears that she, like Grace before her, has a crush on Will. Laila Markus, Grace and Leo 's daughter, is played by Maria Thayer. Laila was conceived by Leo and Grace on an aircraft, during a period where her parents were divorced. She was going to be raised by Will and Grace, but her parents remarried shortly before her birth. She appears on screen only during the series finale. Warren, played by Jesse Fremont Allis, is the imaginary son of Grace and Leo in a dream that Grace has during the last episode of season 8. Grace and Will raise ' their ' son together."

When certain diploid cells in animals undergo cytokinesis after meiosis to produce egg cells, they sometimes divide unevenly. Most of the cytoplasm is segregated into one daughter cell, which becomes the egg or ovum, while the smaller polar bodies only get a small amount of cytoplasm. They frequently die (apoptosis) and disappear, but in some cases they remain and can be important in the life cycle of the organism."

    "text": "One of the most influential studies of this phenomenon was done by Robert Cialdini in 1976 known as The Three (Football) Field Study. He discovered that the students sought to have the success of their football team linked to them by wearing school - identified apparel. These students associated themselves with a success, even though they in no way affected or caused the success. Through three different experiments, Cialdini was able to demonstrate the BIRGing phenomenon. The first experiment demonstrated BIRGing by showing that students have a greater tendency to wear apparel with the university 's colors and name after the football team had won a game. In the second experiment, subjects used the pronoun \"we '' to associate themselves more with a positive than a negative source. This was shown most prominently when their public reputation was at risk. When the subjects failed a task, they had a greater tendency to affiliate themselves with a winner, and less of a tendency to associate themselves with a loser. The third experiment replicated the finding that students used the pronoun \"we '' more when describing a victory compared to a non-victory by their school 's football team. The researchers found that BIRGing is an attempt to enhance one 's public image. The tendency to proclaim a connection with a positive source was strongest when one 's public image was threatened. Thus, people bask in reflected glory to boost their self - esteem by associating themselves with a positive source."
