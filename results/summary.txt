A²-RAG (Adaptive & Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Evaluation Summary Report
================================================================================

METRIC DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EM (Exact Match):
   - Binary metric: 1 if prediction exactly matches reference, 0 otherwise
   - CAVEAT: NQ answers are often short spans; EM is inherently strict
   - Low EM scores are expected and normal for open-domain QA

2. F1 (Token-Level Overlap):
   - Measures token-level recall and precision
   - PRIMARY METRIC for Natural Questions dataset evaluation
   - Rewards partial correct answers with shared key terms
   - More interpretable than EM for academic comparison

3. Hit Rate:
   - Measures if the correct answer appears in retrieved context
   - Reflects retrieval quality: did RAG find relevant documents?
   - Important for understanding retrieval effectiveness

4. Avg Latency:
   - Average time per query in seconds
   - Includes LLM inference, retrieval, and decision-making
   - A²-RAG typically slower due to decision overhead

5. Avg Num Queries:
   - Average API calls per query (decision LLM + generation LLM)
   - A²-RAG efficiency: skipped retrieval = fewer queries
   - Key metric for understanding cost/quota savings
